A clarification will be added at the end of page 729, before section
29.2.3. The clarification is printed below.

> If you have followed all the instructions in each Chapter, you will
  already have installed `django-debug-toolbar`, but perhaps not
  `django-extensions` or `ipython`. To install these dependencies to run
  the site in development, you may run the command below.

{% highlight shell %}
$ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
