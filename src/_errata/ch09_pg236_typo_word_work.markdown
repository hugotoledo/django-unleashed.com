Towards the middle of the page, the books reads (emphasis added):

> Given that a Django form has three states, we know that the minimum number of
  states we must deal with is three. What’s more, from our preceding **word**, we
  also know that we don’t need any more states than the ones we have defined.

The text should read 'What’s more, from our preceding work...'
