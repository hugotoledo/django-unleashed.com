title: Wrong Example Referenced
edition: 1
chapter: 7

In the second paragraph on page 206, between examples 7.24 and 7.25, the text
reads:

> The result of `is_valid()` (Example 7.25) might seem confusing at first...

The text should be referencing the example above it, number 7.24, instead of
example 7.25.
