title: PostgreSQL listed as PostreSQL
slug: postgresql_listed_postresql
edition: 1
chapter: 31 # index
page: 798

The index has a typo on page 798 (right column, 4 lines down) where
[*PostgreSQL*](http://www.postgresql.org/) is listed without the *g*. It
is therefore not listed in the correct position alphabetically,
(appearing after entries such as *PostManager*, instead of before).

Thanks to Evan Palmer for catching the error.
