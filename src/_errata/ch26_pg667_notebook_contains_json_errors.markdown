title: Jupyter/IPython Notebook Does Not Load
slug: notebook-does-not-load
edition: 1
chapter: 26

The [Juypter][Jupyter] Notebook referred to on page 667 contains a typo that
makes Jupyter unable to load the notebook.

I've fixed the issue in the git repository, meaning that it becomes possible to
run the notebook in the latest commit, but not before.

You can [view the notebook on Github.][Chapter 26 Notebook on Github]
